# Time_difference_Calculator

--A GUI where a user is able to input two time periods (starting and ending) and the output returns the difference between two time periods. This GUI can be used to help expedite tasks such as scheduling, or tallying the  number of hours worked by an employee. I built this to learn more about developing GUI's in python using the Tkinter package. This GUI utilizes a python script.
